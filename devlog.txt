- INITIAL DD REVIEW: Try to more efficiently merge like tables together to simplify code.
Make it clearer the process of connecting the ‘WEBPAGEINFO’ and ‘WEBPAGES’ tables and how we will use that to access usernames and the webpages they edited.
Review the tables to make sure the ‘WEBPAGES’ table allows storage of multiple editors.
Clearly define what way we will categorize the webpages list and what counts as popular pages. Add rough dates to tasks & roles chart for better organization.

Need heading

- Login Functionality Completed
By cannibalizing 18_session I was able to add a login function that asks for one other parameter from the user (a password) and compare it to a database of users.
Thus, we can verify that a user exists on the platform.
However, since the actualy SQLITE3 table of users doesn't exist yet, I'm just using a hard-coded dictionary as a placeholder. Should be okay to convert a SQLITE3 table to dict.
Also reorganized the file into sections (login, webpage rendering, etc)
If anyone has any questions lmk

- SECOND DD REVIEW: Clarify how we use content and previousEdit to build our blog, and merge tables together. Clear up where the history page will go if it is included in the final design. Emphasize the instructions of our scenario, and what each instruction’s limitations are. Condense the webstory paragraphs. Clearly define mermaid diagrams using a white background.
