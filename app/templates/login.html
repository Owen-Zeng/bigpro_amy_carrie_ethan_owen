     simple demo of HTML forms via Flask

     trioTASK:
     If any member of team has forms experience, let osmosis reign...
     If no one does, seek external assistance (local first).

     PROTIP: Revisit code from foundations if you have it.
     Peruse this code together and discuss how it should work,
       in conjunction with the back end apparatus.
